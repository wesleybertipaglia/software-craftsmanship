Welcome to **Software Craftsmanship**!

This repository is dedicated to **practical programming challenges** that encourage you to *build real systems from scratch*. The focus is on **understanding how things are constructed**, exploring architecture, algorithms, and data structures, and improving your skills as a software artisan.

Every challenge is an opportunity to **craft software thoughtfully**, from utilities to complex applications, without being restricted by programming language or abstraction level.

# Engineering Challenge - Dropbox

## Introduction

Create a file storage and sharing service where users can upload, organize, and share files across devices. This challenge explores cloud storage, file synchronization, and sharing permissions.

### Objectives

- Understand distributed file storage systems
- Implement file upload, download, and synchronization
- Handle sharing and collaboration features
- Learn about data security and access control

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Choose your preferred programming language and web framework
    - Set up a project structure following common conventions for your chosen language/framework (e.g., src/ or app/ for source files, tests/ for test files, storage/ for file handling)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create user accounts and storage quotas
    - Build file upload and download functionality
    - Implement folder organization and file versioning
    - Add sharing links and collaboration features
    - Handle cross-device synchronization

3. **Testing**:
    - Test file upload and download operations
    - Verify sharing permissions and access control
    - Check synchronization across multiple clients
    - Test with large files and concurrent users

### Possible Improvements

- Add real-time collaboration (like Google Docs)
- Implement file versioning and recovery
- Add encryption and security features
- Create desktop and mobile sync clients

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand the complexities of cloud storage systems and file synchronization technologies.

Happy coding!

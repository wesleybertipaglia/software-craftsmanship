# Software Craftsmanship - Uber

## Introduction

Design and implement a simplified ride-hailing system simulation, similar to Uber. This challenge explores real-time systems, geolocation, matching algorithms, and distributed coordination.

### Objectives

- Understand ride-hailing system architecture
- Implement driver-rider matching algorithms
- Handle real-time location updates and routing
- Learn about system scalability and coordination

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**: 
    - Choose your preferred programming language and framework
    - Set up a project structure following common conventions for your chosen language/framework (e.g., src/ or app/ for source files, tests/ for test files, db/ or migrations/ for database setup)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create user and driver registration systems
    - Implement location tracking and geofencing
    - Build ride request and matching system
    - Add pricing calculation and payment processing
    - Handle ride lifecycle from request to completion

3. **Testing**:
    - Simulate multiple drivers and riders
    - Test matching algorithms under different loads
    - Verify location accuracy and routing
    - Check system performance with concurrent requests

### Possible Improvements

- Add real-time ride tracking and ETA calculations
- Implement surge pricing based on demand
- Add driver ratings and reputation system
- Create mobile app interfaces

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand the complexities of real-time location-based services and matching systems.

Happy coding!
